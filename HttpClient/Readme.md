# Readme HttpClient 

## Porpose of solution:

* Building a custom domainclient (OpenRiaServices.DomainServices.PortableWeb) that will hopefylle later be incorporated into OpenRiaServices

## IMPORTANT:

1. To capture the communication for non-SL clients you you can use Fiddler (http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) while debugging 
but then you should change the server uri to use _localhost.fiddler_ instead of just _localhost_.
